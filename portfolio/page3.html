            <h2>maintaining equilibrium using torque</h2>    
            <p>In order to receive extra credit in our AP Physics class, we were to design and complete our own lab incorporating the concepts we had learned about in class. We were allowed to do this in groups or individually.</p>
            <p>My group, consisting of me and two other students, created a lab in which we used torque to calculate the distance from the axis of rotation required to balance a mass with another, different mass. The calculated distance was compared to the measured distance.</p>
