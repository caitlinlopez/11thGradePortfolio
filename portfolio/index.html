            <p>Hello! My name is Caitlin Lopez and I am currently a junior at Pasadena High School. My favorite classes are AP Physics and Web Application Development, since they allow me to creatively apply the concepts we have learned in class into interesting assignments. In Web Application Development, I have been able to learn the languages of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was able to utilize these skills at my internship at CalTech this past summer. In addition, I founded and am the president of WECode, or Women Educated in Code, which seeks to get more young women interested and enthusiastic about computer science. I am also a member of the Astronomy Club at my school. I would like to attend Harvey Mudd College after I graduate to pursue computer science.</p>
