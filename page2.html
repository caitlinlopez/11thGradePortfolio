            <p>For my capstone project in sophomore year, I created WhatToWear, a program that gives the user a five-day weather forecast and recommends an outfit to wear based on the weather. The user inputs a zipcode to retrieve the forecast for that area. This is done through a third party API for weather conditions around the world, so any zipcode would be functionable. I chose to make this program because it would potentially simplify my weekly task of planning out my outfits for the week. I enjoyed this project because it allowed me to create something useful for me, in addition to making an aesthetically-pleasing website. To be able to view an outfit for a specific day, click on the specific day and an outfit will be displayed using several arrays.</p>
